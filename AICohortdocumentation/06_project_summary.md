### Judging Presentation (10 minutes)

**Minute 1-2: Hook**
```
"In India, 22% of surgical patients are readmitted within 30 days.
That's 1 in 4 patients coming back to the hospital.
Why? Because nobody monitors them after discharge.

Arogya-Pulse solves this with AI-powered home monitoring."
```

**Minute 2-4: Demo Video (live or recorded)**
```
Show:
1. Patient opens app → fills check-in form (takes 1 min)
2. System uploads wound photo → AI analyzes (3 seconds)
3. Doctor dashboard shows all patients with risk scores
4. Alerts trigger for high-risk patients
5. Doctor schedules tele-consult with one click
6. WhatsApp bot sends reminder to rural patient
```

**Minute 4-7: Technical Stack**
```
"Built on:
- Flutter (Mobile App for Doctor, Nurse, Patient)
- Next.js (Web Dashboard for Doctor, Nurse, Patient)
- Node.js backend (hospital can run locally)
- PostgreSQL (secure, HIPAA-ready)
- TensorFlow (pre-trained ResNet50 for wound analysis)

Completely open-source, zero licensing costs.
Can be deployed on any hospital server."
```

**Minute 7-9: Impact**
```
"At a 400-bed hospital:
- Current: 22% readmission rate = 528 patients/year
- With Arogya-Pulse: 10% readmission rate = 240 patients/year
- Lives improved: 288 patients/year
- Cost saved: ₹23 crores/year

Scalable to 10,000 hospitals = ₹2,30,000 crores/year impact"
```

**Minute 9-10: Business Model**
```
"Revenue options:
1. Hospital subscription: ₹5 lakhs/month per 400-bed hospital
2. Per-patient monitoring: ₹500/patient for 30-day monitoring
3. Insurance partnership: Reduce readmissions, split savings

First hospital pilot: 3 months → ₹50 lakhs investment
ROI: 350% (pays back in 3 months)"
```

## One More Thing

This project doesn't just win hackathons.
It **saves lives**.

Every patient you help avoid readmission:
- Experiences less suffering
- Saves ₹50,000-150,000 in medical costs
- Returns to work faster
- Trusts the healthcare system more

If you build this, even one hospital pilot:
- 60+ patients avoid readmission/month
- ₹48 lakhs saved/month
- Lives changed permanently

**Make it real. Make it work. Make it matter.**
